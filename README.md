## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- BEM methodology

### What I learned

I tend to have CSS naming issues when I am working on projects that do not use any frameworks. I was browsing around different CSS methodologies, and decided to try and build this simple project using BEM to get my feet wet.

### Continued development

If I had more time, I would research how to dynamically set font sizes without using media queries.
